LAKSHMI AI





Lakshmi-AI is a Flutter-based mobile developed to empower rural women by providing AI-driven investment strategies tailored to their needs. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, the app delivers personalized, easy-to-understand financial guidance to help users make smarter investment decisions, even with little to no prior financial knowledge.

The goal of Lakshmi-AI is to bridge the financial literacy gap for women in underserved communities by using conversational AI to deliver actionable insights in an accessible and supportive way.

This project was developed as part of the EY (Ernst & Young) Techathon, where we successfully advanced to the second round.
